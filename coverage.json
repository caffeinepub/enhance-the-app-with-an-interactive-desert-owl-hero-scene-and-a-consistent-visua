Ensure the backend (backend/main.mo) compiles and deploys correctly, and all frontend source files are bundled and served without errors. The deployment must restore the app to its last intended state including: the nine-column BirdDataTable with all five admin-only action buttons (إضافة, تعديل, حفظ, حذف, تحرير) visible and functional for authenticated admin users; the interactive AllLocationsMap with bird filtering and show/hide toggle; the BirdGallery with admin action buttons and image click modal; the HomePage with splash screen, hero section, navigation cards, map upload section, and team table; the HamburgerMenu with all navigation links; and all TanStack Router routes correctly registered (/data, /gallery, /map, /bird/:name, /eagle-owl, /statistics, /image-view, /permissions).",
