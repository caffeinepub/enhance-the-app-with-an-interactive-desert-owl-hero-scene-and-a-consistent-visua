      "text": "Revert the entire project — both backend (backend/main.mo, backend/migration.mo) and all frontend source files — to the exact state of Draft Version 510. No new modifications, fixes, or feature additions should be applied during this revert. The result must be a faithful restoration of the Draft Version 510 codebase, including all bird records, blob storage, role-based access control, navigation buttons, image display pipelines, splash screen, and homepage sections that were present and functional at that version.",

        "The home page hero section, all navigation buttons (gallery, map, eagle owl, statistics, permissions), the bird data table, the static Al Buraimi map, and the team data table all render correctly on first load without requiring authentication",
        "All routes (/, /gallery, /bird/:name, /map, /eagle-owl, /statistics, /image-view, /permissions) are registered and navigable",
        "Images stored in blob storage are fetched and displayed correctly across BirdDetailsPage, BirdGallery, and AllLocationsMap — all uploaded images per bird are shown, not just the first one",
        "The admin user with principal ID '5uylz-j7fcd-isj73-gp57f-xwwyy-po2ib-7iboa-fdkdv-nrsam-3bd3r-qqe' retains admin privileges and the admin link is visible in MainHeader when authenticated",
        "All previously stored bird records, user profiles, team data, blob storage entries, and access control settings are preserved after deployment",
