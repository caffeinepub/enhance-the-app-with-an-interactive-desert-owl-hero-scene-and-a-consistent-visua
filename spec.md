# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the entire project (backend and frontend) to the exact state of Draft Version 510, restoring the stable baseline without any new modifications.

**Planned changes:**
- Revert `backend/main.mo` and `backend/migration.mo` to their Draft Version 510 state
- Revert all frontend source files to their Draft Version 510 state
- Restore all bird records, blob storage, role-based access control, navigation buttons, image display pipelines, splash screen, and homepage sections as they existed in Version 510

**User-visible outcome:** The app is restored to the stable Draft Version 510 baseline, with the splash screen, hero section, all navigation buttons, bird data table, static Al Buraimi map, team data table, and all routes functioning exactly as they did in that version.
