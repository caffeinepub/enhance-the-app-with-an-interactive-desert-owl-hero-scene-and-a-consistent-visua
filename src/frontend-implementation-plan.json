          "description": "Restore the Add Data button UI in the toolbar section. Verify the authorization component's usage instructions before implementing to ensure proper role-based access control is applied. The button should check canCallerModifyData() and be disabled for unauthorized users. Connect the button click handler to open the existing dialog state for creating new bird records. Ensure the dialog form includes all required fields: Arabic name, scientific name, English name, coordinates (latitude/longitude), image upload using the blob-storage component's useFileUpload hook, audio file upload, description, and notes. Wire the form submission to call the backend addBirdWithDetails method with all collected data. After successful creation, invalidate the bird data query cache to refresh the table. Maintain RTL Arabic layout and preserve existing inline editing and export functionality."
