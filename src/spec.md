# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the missing Add Data button in the bird data table to allow users to create new bird records.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an "Add Data" button to the BirdDataTable component
- Create a dialog/form that opens when the button is clicked
- Include form fields for bird name, coordinates, images, audio files, and description
- Enable form submission to create new bird records
- Display newly created records in the table after submission

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click the Add Data button in the bird data table page to open a form, fill in bird information including name, location coordinates, images, audio recordings, and description, then submit to create new bird records that appear in the table.
