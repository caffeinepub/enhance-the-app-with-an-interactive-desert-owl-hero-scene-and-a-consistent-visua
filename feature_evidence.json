The five buttons must be: (1) 'إضافة' (Add) in the table toolbar/header area — inserts a new empty editable row at the top of the table; (2) 'تعديل' (Edit) on each data row — switches that row into inline edit mode; (3) 'حفظ' (Save) that replaces the Edit button when a row is in edit mode and commits changes to the backend; (4) 'حذف' (Delete) on each row — removes the record from the backend; (5) 'تحرير' (Update/Edit) on each row — alternative update action. The isAdmin check must use a useState + useEffect pattern that correctly triggers a re-render after the actor/identity resolves, ensuring buttons appear once admin identity is confirmed. All column definitions, layout, RTL orientation, horizontal scrolling, color scheme, font sizes, and data-fetching logic must remain exactly as they are.
