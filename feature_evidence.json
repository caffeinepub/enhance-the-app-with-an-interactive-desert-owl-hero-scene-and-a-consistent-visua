      "featureTitle": "In frontend/src/components/BirdGallery.tsx only, restore the main image upload, sub-image upload, and audio upload functionality so that images and audio uploaded through the gallery admin controls are immediately reflected in the photo gallery cards without requiring a separate navigation step. Specifically: (1) The 'إضافة' (Add) button's form/modal must correctly upload the main image and sub-images as blobs to the backend, store the resulting blob IDs in the bird record's images array, and refresh the gallery so the new card with its images is immediately visible. (2) The 'تحرير' (Update/Edit) button's editable state must correctly upload replacement images and persist them to the bird record. (3) The 'إضافة الصوت' (Add Audio) button must upload the audio file as a blob, associate the blob ID with the bird record's audio field, and the audio must be immediately accessible from the gallery card. Do NOT change any other aspect of BirdGallery.tsx — existing search, card layout, RTL orientation, data-fetching logic, image-click modal, admin guard logic, or any other admin buttons must remain exactly as they are. Do NOT modify any other file, component, page, route, or backend file.",
