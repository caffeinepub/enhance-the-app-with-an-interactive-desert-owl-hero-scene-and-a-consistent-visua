  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/BirdDataTable.tsx and updates the getZone function. The implementation returns '40' for the latitude range 23.5–35° (which previously returned 'Tropical' or equivalent) as well as the 0–23.5° range. The file summary confirms this. However, the requirement targets cells displaying 'Tropical' in both read-only and inline-edit modes. Two other ancillary files were also modified.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-119",
      "requirement": "The substitution of 'Tropical' to '40' must apply to the editable input fields when a row is in inline-edit mode.",
      "reason": "The diff shows getZone() was updated but there is no evidence in the truncated diff that the editable input field in inline-edit mode explicitly handles the 'Tropical' to '40' substitution for display purposes.",

      "reason": "REQ-119 only asks to replace cells displaying 'Tropical' with '40'. Changing the equatorial zone (0-23.5 degrees) to also return '40' goes beyond the stated requirement.",
