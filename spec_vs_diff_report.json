  "summary": "The build request (REQ-93) explicitly requires a rebuild/redeploy with ZERO source code changes to any file. However, the diff shows that at least two frontend source files were modified: BirdDataTable.tsx and BirdGallery.tsx. Additionally, frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json were modified. The constraint 'Do not modify any source file — backend or frontend' and the acceptance criterion 'No source file is modified during this deployment' are directly violated.",
