  "summary": "The diff modifies AllLocationsMap.tsx, BirdDataTable.tsx, and BirdGallery.tsx as required. All three components implement the useState+useEffect pattern for isAdmin checks and data fetching. The implementation appears to cover the core requirements for REQ-107, REQ-108, and REQ-109 based on the available (truncated) diff content. Two additional files were also modified (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), which are metadata/documentation files rather than functional components. The truncation of the diff prevents full verification of all acceptance criteria details.",
