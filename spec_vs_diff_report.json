  "summary": "Both modified files (BirdDataTable.tsx and BirdGallery.tsx) show evidence of restored admin action buttons with the required useState + useEffect isAdmin pattern. The file summaries confirm all five buttons in BirdDataTable (إضافة/تعديل/حفظ/حذف/تحرير) and all four buttons in BirdGallery (إضافة/تحرير/حذف/حفظ) are present. The implementation uses the lastIdentityRef pattern as required. Two additional files were modified (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), which appear to be metadata/state tracking files. The diff is truncated so complete verification of all acceptance criteria is limited.",
