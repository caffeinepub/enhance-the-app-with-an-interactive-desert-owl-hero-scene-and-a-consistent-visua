  "summary": "The build request explicitly requires NO code changes — only a clean rebuild and redeploy of the existing codebase. However, the diff shows two modified files: backend/main.mo and project_state.json. Even though the content shown appears to be the existing backend code, the fact that these files are listed as 'Modified' in the diff technically violates the core constraint of REQ-141, which states no source files may be modified. The diff does not provide evidence of actual deployment artifacts (compiled Wasm, bundled frontend assets, deployment logs), making it impossible to verify that all acceptance criteria were actually met.",
