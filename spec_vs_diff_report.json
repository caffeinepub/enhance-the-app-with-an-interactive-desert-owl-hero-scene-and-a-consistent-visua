REQ-2 is addressed by fixing the edit button rendering and edit dialog in BirdGallery. REQ-3 is addressed by adding image and audio file upload inputs to the BirdGallery edit dialog with blob upload and bird record update. Backend changes (mainImage field, migration) support REQ-3. No missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
