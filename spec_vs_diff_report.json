  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/BirdDataTable.tsx to implement the full CRUD button functionality (Add/Edit/Save/Delete) for authenticated admin users with the desert/amber RTL Arabic theme. The implementation appears to cover all acceptance criteria based on the file summary and truncated code. Two other files are also modified (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), which are metadata/state tracking files rather than functional source files, so they do not violate the constraint of only modifying BirdDataTable.tsx in terms of actual app functionality.",

      "reason": "The file summary mentions 'حفظ (Save)/إلغاء (Cancel) when editing', but the acceptance criteria only specify that the Edit button is replaced by a Save button — no Cancel button was requested.",
