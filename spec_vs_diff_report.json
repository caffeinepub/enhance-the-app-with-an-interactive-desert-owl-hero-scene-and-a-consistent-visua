  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/AllLocationsMap.tsx to remove the static map image element. The map container now uses a bg-muted background instead of rendering a static image. Two other files were also modified: frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json, which are metadata/state files. The core requirement (removing the static map image from AllLocationsMap.tsx) appears to be implemented. However, the constraint that no other file may be modified is potentially violated by changes to frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json.",
