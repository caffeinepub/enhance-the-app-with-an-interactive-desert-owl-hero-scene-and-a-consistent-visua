  "summary": "The diff modifies BirdDataTable.tsx, BirdGallery.tsx, and useQueries.ts (plus metadata files). Both primary component files show restoration of admin action buttons with useState+useEffect isAdmin patterns and data-fetching logic. The implementation appears largely complete for all three requirements, though the diff is truncated so some details cannot be fully verified.",

      "description": "Modification of frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts",
      "reason": "The build request explicitly states 'Do NOT modify any other file, component, page, route, or backend file beyond BirdDataTable.tsx and BirdGallery.tsx'. The diff shows useQueries.ts was modified, which violates this constraint even if the changes appear to be data-fetching related fixes.",
